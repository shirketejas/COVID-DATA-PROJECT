Project Info:
This SQL-based COVID-19 data analysis project uses two main tables: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations. It calculates key metrics such as death percentages, infection rates, and vaccination progress. The project employs various SQL techniques including joins, CTEs, temp tables, and views to manipulate and analyze the data effectively, providing insights into the pandemic's global impact.

Project Description:
This SQL project analyzes COVID-19 data, revealing key insights:

1.US had the highest death count (576,232), followed by Brazil, Mexico, and IndiaNorth America experienced the most deaths among continents, while Oceania had the leastIndia's COVID-19 death rate was around 1.105%, with about 1.4% of its population infected
2.Andorra had the highest infection rate relative to its population
3.Global COVID-19 death percentage was approximately 2.1%
4.The project examines total cases vs deaths, infection rates, death counts, and vaccination progress
5.It utilizes various SQL techniques like joins, CTEs, temp tables, and views for data analysis
6.Custom views were created for total death counts, percent population infected, and death percentages
7.The analysis provides insights into pandemic trends across countries and continents
